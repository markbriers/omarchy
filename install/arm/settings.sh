# Install the files that the omarchy-settings package normally owns.
#
# On x86_64 every file below arrives through pacman: the ISO pacstraps
# omarchy-settings, which drops the /etc tree, seeds /etc/skel, and installs
# the session, unit, font and theme files under /usr and /usr/lib. There is no
# aarch64 build of that package, so on ARM this script places the same files
# straight from the checkout.
#
# The mapping follows docs/file-layout.md. Two groups are deliberately left
# out, because on ARM they would touch a boot chain this fork does not own:
#
#   - mkinitcpio.conf.d/ and the plymouth initramfs hook. A Raspberry Pi boots
#     through its own firmware and linux-rpi; an Apple Silicon Mac boots
#     through m1n1 and U-Boot. Rewriting initramfs hooks on either is how a
#     machine stops booting.
#   - limine-entry-tool.d/ and default/limine/. Limine is the x86 bootloader
#     Omarchy installs; neither target uses it.
#
# Run as root. Honours OMARCHY_ARM_DRY_RUN=1.
